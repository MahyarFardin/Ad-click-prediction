# Ad click project with Random Forest and Decision tree

In this project, I tried to predict whether someone with some given information
will click on an advertisement on the internet or not.

## Features of the dataset 
- Daily Time Spent on Site: Daily Time Spent on Site by users
- Age: age of the users
- Area Income: income of the users
- Daily Internet Usage
- Ad Topic Line: the text written on the ad's title
- City: City of the users
- Male: whether they are male or not
- Country: Country of the users
- Timestamp: time of the day they clicked on the Ad
- Clicked on Ad: whether or not they clicked on the add

## Walkthrough

**Step 1**: Loading data and extracting some information from it about attributes


**Step 2**: Preprocessing:

*It is important to mention that a deep analysis of this dataset is available under my data analysis repository*
- Finding missing values using a heatmap
- Finding a correlation between attributes
- Removing non-numeric values ( *in another project I will replace them with numeric values to see whether it will increase the accuracy or not* )

**Step 3**:Appling all of the models
